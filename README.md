# primesum
Find the number of subarrays with a prime sum

# Output

```
Lets's try:
[4, 7, 4, 5 ]
numOfPossibleArrays: 10

[4]
[4, 7]
11 is Prime *
[7]
7 is Prime *
[4, 7, 4]
[7, 4]
11 is Prime *
[4]
[4, 7, 4, 5]
[7, 4, 5]
[4, 5]
[5]
5 is Prime *
PRiMES: 4

[3, 8, 4, 5 ]
numOfPossibleArrays: 10
[3]
3 is Prime *
[3, 8]
11 is Prime *
[8]
[3, 8, 4]
[8, 4]
[4]
[3, 8, 4, 5]
[8, 4, 5]
17 is Prime *
[4, 5]
[5]
5 is Prime *

PRiMES: 4

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
